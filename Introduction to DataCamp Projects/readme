This project is an introductory project from Data Camp and it is just an introduction to the DataCamp project interface.
Projects allows me to practice and apply the skills I have learned in the DataCamp courses. 
In each project I have carried out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows. 
In this project  I have learnt using Jupyter Notebook and some of Python libray like PANDAS and MATPLOTLIB.
I have also created some graph and plot from real world data using those python library.
